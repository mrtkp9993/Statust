## Planned features

Following features are considered as minimal requirements and planned for first releases:

- [x] Read data from flat files (txt, csv etc.),
- [x] Descriptive statistics,
- [ ] Generate samples from different statistical distributions,
- [ ] Normality tests,
- [ ] Correlations,
- [ ] t-tests, basic regression models like ordinary least squares (OLS),
- [ ] basic optimization methods,

The following are more specific features and planned for later versions:

- [ ] Read data from urls and databases,
- [ ] Distribution tests and distribution fitting,
- [ ] Data filtering and aggregation,
- [ ] Data transformations,
- [ ] Outlier tests,
- [ ] General linear models,
- [ ] Nonparametric methods,
- [ ] Clustering,
- [ ] Time series analysis,
- [ ] Survival analysis,
- [ ] Repeated measures,
- [ ] Report results as docx and pdf,
- [ ] Plotting.

These requirements are not final and can be changed.
